# Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game
A classic Stone-Paper-Scissors Game implementation
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share my interactive coding project: a command-line Stone Paper Scissors game!

## Let's Play! ðŸš€

This is a classic one-on-one game against the computer. Here's how it works:

1.  When you run the game, you'll be prompted to enter your choice: "stone", "paper", or "scissors".
2.  The computer will then make its own selection randomly behind the scenes.
3.  The outcome of the round is determined by the well-known rules: stone crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers stone.
4.  The game will announce the choices made by both you and the computer, and declare the winner of that round.
5.  score tracker to keep count of wins and losses.

## What I LearnedðŸ§ 

Creating this simple game was a great learning experience. It helped me solidify my understanding of:

* *User Input:* Taking text input from the player.
* *Random Number Generation:* Making the computer's choice unpredictable.
* *Conditional Logic:* Using if, elif, and else statements to implement the game's rules and determine the winner.
* *Variables:* Storing the player's choice, the computer's choice, and potentially the score.
* *Game Loops:* Allowing the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

## Thanks for Checking Out My Project! ðŸ˜Š

I'm really happy with how my first game turned out. I'd love to hear any feedback you might have!
